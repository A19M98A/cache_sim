# Cache Simulation Script

## Overview

This Python script simulates a cache using the provided `Cache` class from the "Cache" module. The simulation takes user input for cache parameters, reads a workload file containing hexadecimal addresses, and simulates cache accesses. The progress of the simulation is displayed using a color-coded progress bar, and the final state of the cache is printed.

## Usage

1. **Cache Parameters Input:**
   - Run the script, and it will prompt you to input the following cache parameters:
     - Cache Size (KB)
     - Cache Block Size (B)
     - Cache Associativity
     - Cache Replacement Policy ([LRU], NMRU, Random)

2. **Workload Input:**
   - Enter the name of the workload file containing hexadecimal addresses when prompted.

3. **Simulation Progress:**
   - The script will display a progress bar during the simulation, indicating the percentage completion.

4. **Final Cache State:**
   - Once the simulation is complete, the script will print the final state of the cache.

## Prerequisites

- Ensure that the "Cache" module is available and contains the necessary implementation for the `Cache` class.

## Notes

- The workload file is expected to contain lines with hexadecimal addresses.
- The progress bar may not update correctly in some environments; adjustments may be needed based on your console's support for ANSI escape codes.

## Example

```bash
$ python cache_simulation.py
Cache Size (KB): 64
Cache Block Size (B): 64
Cache Associativity: 4
Replacement policy ([LRU], NMRU, Random): LRU
Workload: example_workload.txt

start simulation    
 [==============>                             ] 30%     
```
